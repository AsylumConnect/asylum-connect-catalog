description: Washington Gender Alliance is dedicated to helping people deal with the issues of gender identity and/or expression, be it their own, or those of someone in their lives. They do this primarily by conducting community-oriented, peer-facilitated, open support groups. The only requirement for participation is that participants' lives somehow be impacted by transgenderism.
